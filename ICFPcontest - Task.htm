                        <P><B>The Market for Cars and Fuels</B></P>
                        <P>You are in the automobile business and you are
                        manufacturing cars and fuels. Each car has subtly
                        different specifications, so some fuels may suit its
                        engine, and others may not. Given a car and a fuel, it
                        is easy to check whether the fuel fits the car, and that
                        is what the contest server will be doing. Given only the
                        car, it may not be easy to design a fuel that fits. This
                        will be part of your task. Cars are open-sourced (anyone
                        can read their specification), but fuels are closed-sourced
                        (so you cannot copy others' fuels).</P>

                        <P>During the contest, you will execute two types of
                        actions:</P>

                        <UL>
                            <LI>compute and upload fuel for a car;</LI>
                            <LI>upload a new car, with matching fuel.</LI>
                        </UL>

                        <P>This is your source of income, and we will compute
                        and display your score (in short intervals).</P>

                        <P>Each car on the market is a constant source of
                        profit. For each car, the profit is shared among all
                        manufacturers of fuels for that car. This includes the
                        creator of the car. Shares are unequal, and the
                        distribution of profits favors those suppliers with
                        efficient fuel factories.</P>

                        <P>So your aim is to design fuels that fit others' cars,
                        and to design cars for which you can supply fuel, but
                        others cannot.</P>

                        <P>Initially, some cars are already on the market.
                        During the contest, more will be added, by participants,
                        and possibly by the organizers.</P>

                        <P>At any time during the contest, the number of cars
                        submitted by you cannot be larger that number of others'
                        cars for which you did supply fuels.</P>

                        <P>During the contest, you may submit at most 72 cars
                        (seventy-two, the number of hours of the contest
                        duration).</P>

                        <P>This bound is independent of whether you take part in
                        the lightning division, or the main division. In
                        particular, if you used up your car submission quota
                        during the lightning division, you may continue to take
                        part in the contest, but only by submitting fuels.</P>

                        <HR>
                        
<A name="scoring"></A>
                        <H2>Scoring</H2>

                        <P>For each car, shares are paid out to each team that
                        has provided fuel for that car. Fuels are sorted by
                        size, and (for equal size) time of submission. So,
                        smaller and earlier is better, and smaller is more
                        important. If there are n teams for one car, then they
                        get 1/n, 1/(n+1), ... 1/(2*n-1) points, respectively.
                        </P>

                        <P>The fuel that was initially provided by the team that
                        built the car, does also take part in this evaluation.
                        This is the way to ensure that the car's designer gets
                        some profit.</P>

                        <P>Shares pay dividends at regular intervals. 
			  The payments will be
                        accumulated on the team's account. Sadly, there will be
                        a tax: in each period, you have to pay a fixed
                        percentage, in such a way that you will lose 50 percent over the
                        course of one day.</P>

                        <P>When you submit a new car, it will be published
                        immediately. It will start producing profit
                        only after one full time period.</P>

                        <P>The teams' scores will be published (updated after
                        each period) - but we will hide the top five entries
                        from this highscore list. The top teams will be asked
                        to send in their source code for examination, and the
                        winners of the contest will only be announced at the
                        ICFP conference this September.</P>

<A name="technical"></A>
                        <H2>Technical Specification of Cars</H2>

                        <P>A car's engine is given by a list of reaction
                        chambers. Each chamber contains two pipes (called the
                        upper and the lower pipe). Each pipe is a sequence of
                        sections. Both pipes suck in air, which is freely
                        available, and is in fact a mixture of several
                        ingredients.</P>

                        <P>In each section, a chemical reaction combines
                        ingredients coming from the neighboring section on the
                        left, and of fuel that is fed directly to the section
                        from a fuel tank, and the output ingredients are fed to
                        the next section on the right. Finally, the output of
                        the upper and lower pipe are joined to the Difference
                        Engine that actually produces mechanical energy. The
                        connections from tanks to sections are hard-wired by the
                        car manufacturer.</P>

                        <P>For example, a car may have two fuel tanks, numbered
                        0 and 1, respectively. Its engine may consist of just
                        one chamber. There are two pipes. The upper pipe
                        consists of two sections, both fed from tank 0, and the
                        lower pipe consists of three sections, where the first
                        and last are fed from tank 0, while the middle section
                        is fed from tank 1.</P>

                        <PRE>      upper pipe:  -&gt; section -&gt; section ------------.

                        <H2>Proper Cars</H2>

                        <P>A car is only allowed for street traffic if it</P>
                        
                        <UL>
                            <LI>uses at most 6 (six) different fuel tanks,</LI>
                            <LI>is normalized,</LI>
                            <LI>is connected.</LI>
                        </UL>

                        <P>Two cars will be considered equivalent if we can
                        transform one to the other by swapping the order of
                        chambers, duplicating chambers, and swapping the order
                        of tanks. A car is normalized if its ternary encoding
                        (see below) is lexicographically smallest among those of
                        its equivalents.</P>

                        <P>Connectedness is defined via the following: We say
                        that tank t depends on tank s directly, if there is a
                        chamber c such that tank s feeds some section of c's
                        upper pipe, and tank t feeds some section of c's lower
                        pipe. We then say that tank t depends on tank s
                        indirectly, if there is a sequence of dependencies
                        leading from s to t. A car is connected if for each
                        pair of tanks (s,t), tank t depends on tank s. Note that
                        the example car is not connected, since there is no
                        dependency from tank 1 to tank 0.</P>

                        <HR>

                        <H2>Fuels</H2>

                        <P>In each section of a pipe, fuel reacts with air. This
                        changes the composition of air that is fed into the next
                        section. The change is linear, in the sense that the
                        amount of ingredient k in the output of a section
fuelled with  c   is given by 
</P><PRE>out(k) = c(1,k) * in(1) + .. + c(n,k) * in(n)
</PRE>
where in(i) is the amount of ingredient  i  in the incoming air.<P></P>

                        <P>To provide fuel for a car, a manufacturer has to
                        give, for each tank c, the values c(i,k) that
                        characterize its fuel.</P>

                        <P>Air contains many ingredients, but you may choose 
			  the number n of ingredients to work with.</P>


                        <P>The difference engine only works if for each
                        ingredient k, the amount of ingredient k in the upper pipe's output
                        is at least as large as the amount of ingredient k in the output
                        from the lower pipe. This condition must hold for all
                        air conditions, that is, independent of the consistency
                        of incoming air.</P>

                        <P>The first ingredient of air plays a special role: the
                        incoming air will always contain it, the fuels may never
                        remove it (the coefficient c(1,1) must always be
                        positive), and the difference engine needs it.</P>

                        <P>Some of reaction chambers are declared as Main
                        chambers, and here the amount of the first ingredient in
                        the upper pipe's output must be strictly larger than the
                        amount of this ingredient in the lower pipe's output.
                        Other chambers are Auxiliary. The car manufacturer
                        declares whether a chamber is Main or Auxiliary.</P>

<A name="ternary"></A>
                        <H2>Ternary Streams</H2>

                        <P>This wasn't the ICFP contest if it was that easy.</P>

                        <P>Both cars and fuel descriptions are given as
                        structured data, in fact,
			  lists and tuples of ... of lists and tuples of natural numbers.
                        </P>

                        <P>The data for both cars and fuel will be encoded by a
                        stream of trits (ternary bits) and, you guessed it, we
                        won't tell you more about the encoding here, so you just
                        have to make some educated guesses, based on the error
                        messages of the stream parser on our server.</P>

                        <P>Some hints are: the code can handle natural numbers
                        of any size, and lists of any length. The code is
                        self-delimiting, and indeed the parser will ignore
                        trailing garbage after data for fuel, but not for cars.
                        The code has some redundancy (not each trit string is a
                        code word), but not much.</P>

                        <P>For instance, this is the ternary code of some car:
                        </P>

<A name="circuits"></A>
                        <H2>Circuits</H2>

                        <P>Does it still sound easy? Fear not, here's another
                        obstacle: you cannot give the streams for
                        the fuel description literally, but have to write a
                        description for a factory that produces the stream you
                        want from some input stream given by us.</P>

                        <P>The factory is a circuit, built from gates and wires.
                        Each gate has two inputs and two outputs. Each wire
                        connects an output to an input. Each input and output
                        must have exactly one wire. A wire that "goes forward"
                        transports information immediately, and a wire that
                        "goes backward" has a delay of one.</P>

                        <P>To handle interaction with the world outside the
                        circuit, we stipulate that each circuit contains a
                        special "external" gate that has one input and one
                        output. The circuit's input stream appears at the output
                        of the external gate, and the circuit's output stream is
                        fed to the external gate's input.</P>

                        <P>So, the factory is producing a stream that describes
                        fuel. The size of the factory is the number of its
                        gates, and smaller factories are more efficient. (This
                        is important for scoring.)</P>

                        <P>You guessed it, we do not give the semantics of the
                        gates here, and neither the syntax of circuits. Instead,
                        we refer to an example key circuit</P>

                        <P>You need to find its output on your own. The first
                        seventeen output trits, called "the key", have to be
                        prefixed to any ternary stream that encodes a solution.
                        </P>

                        <P>You submit to our server any circuit you want and see
                        the first trits of their output.</P>

                        <P>It is of no direct use to submit the "key circuit"
                        there because our server uses a different input stream.</P>

                        <P>For the initial part of the contest, submit your
                        circuits as solution attempts to Car #0 (with ternary
                        code "0"). This is an extraordinary car that has no
                        chambers, and needs no specific fuel. Its only purpose
                        is to serve as a test case for computing the key prefix.
                        </P>

                        <P>The moment you submit a circuit that produces the key
                        prefix on our server, you will get your first share of
                        profit. Of course if you're late, this may be a small
                        share.</P>



                        <P>After you have submitted 72 cars,
			  you still can make nice profit by fuelling others'
                        cars.</P>

                        <P>The results of the lightning division are scored
                        after exactly 24 hours.
