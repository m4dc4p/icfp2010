# makes the circuit for FUEL_CODE, postfixed wth 2222222, and submits
# that circuit along with CAR_CODE to the test page.  both CAR_CODE
# and FUEL_CODE may contain embedded whitespace, to aid readability.
# (embedded whitespace is removed).

# FUEL_CODE is postfixed with 2222222 to avoid thinking you specified
# a valid fuel when actually you needed more trits, but you got lucky
# and the circuit happenened to produce them. experience shows a
# string of many 2's needs many trits after it.
