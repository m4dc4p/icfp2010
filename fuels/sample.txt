# Fuels are described by tanks. Each file describes
# one fuel. 
# 
# Tanks are separated by at least one non-coment, blank 
# line.
#
# Each tank is a matrix of coeffecients. Matrices
# are specified by rows. Each coefficient is an
# integer number.
#
# Any text after # is considered a comment. There are no
# in-line comments, only per-line or end-of-line comments.
#
# Output is currenty Haskell's "Show" syntax
# for lists, but that can be changed. Each line
# represents a tank.
